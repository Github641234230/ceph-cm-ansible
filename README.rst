Overview
========

This project is meant to store the configuration for the ceph testing labs.


TODO
====

Gonna use this space as notes.

I see us eventually having the following roles.

Roles:
- common (in progress)
- apache
- testnode (testnodes will have packages and repos that say, magna002 or 001 might not have)
- ssh (might just be in common)
- ntp (client and server?)
- teuthology (i.e. setting up magna001)
- paddles
- pulpito
- vpmhost?  (does a vpm host need special things?)
